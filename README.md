Search application for movies to find where it could be streamed (if applicable)




# Movie Streaming Availability Search Tool

## Description

The motivation for this project was to design an application that allows the user to search for a particular movie and be provided with information about that movie, such as an image of the movie's poster, a brief explanation of the plot, the directors, actors, and which streaming services the movie is available on.

The APIs and their specific features used for this project are listed below:

#### OMDb API
Used to fetch general information for movies based on their title and year <br />
[Direct link to API source](http://www.omdbapi.com/)

#### Streaming Availability API
Used to fetch the movie poster for each movie, as well as the available streaming services. <br />

## Future Improvements
-Add hyperlinks to the listed available streaming services for each movie search <br />
-Polish up the general appearance of the application <br />
-Add a "clear history" button to clear past searches and remove their respective search buttons <br />
